#### Overview of the Project

*Project Name:*  
*Data Preprocessing for AI Model Training*


#### Objective:
To develop a robust data preprocessing pipeline that prepares raw datasets for training artificial intelligence models, ensuring the data is clean, transformed, and structured for optimal model performance.


#### Key Activities:

1. *Data Loading:*  
   Read raw data from CSV files into a structured format for analysis.

2. *Data Cleaning:*  
   - Remove duplicates to ensure data integrity.
   - Handle missing values through appropriate imputation strategies.

3. *Data Transformation:*  
   - Convert categorical variables into numerical formats using one-hot encoding.
   - Normalize or standardize numerical features for consistent scaling.

4. *Data Preparation:*  
   - Split the dataset into training and testing subsets to facilitate model evaluation.
   - Separate features and target variables to clearly define input-output relationships.

5. *Feature Scaling:*  
   Apply scaling techniques to ensure features have similar distributions, improving model convergence and accuracy.

6. *Output Generation:*  
   Provide processed datasets ready for AI model training and evaluation.


#### Technology Used:

- *Programming Language:* Python
- *Libraries:*
  - *Pandas:* For data manipulation and analysis.
  - *NumPy:* For numerical operations and handling arrays.
  - *scikit-learn:* For machine learning utilities, including data splitting and feature scaling.
- *Development Environment:* Visual Studio Code (VS Code)


#### Conclusion:

This project provides a foundational framework for efficiently processing datasets in preparation for AI model training, making it easier for data scientists and machine learning practitioners to focus on model development and evaluation.
